✨ Bridging Materials Engineering and Data Science with Machine Learning!
 
💡 I believe in the transformative potential of projects that combine technology, innovation, and real-world impact, especially in industry and applied research. With that in mind, I’m launching a series of posts focused on Machine Learning applications in Materials Science — exploring studies, real-world cases, tools, and breakthroughs that are accelerating the future of this field.

📌 Today I brought an amazing Python Library called PYMATGEN, an open-source Python library for materials analysis.

🧰 Pymatgen (Python Materials Genomics). These are some of the main features:
-	Highly flexible classes for the representation of Element, Site, Molecule, Structure objects.
-	Extensive input/output support, including support for VASP, ABINIT, CIF, Gaussian, XYZ, and many other file formats.
-	Powerful analysis tools, including generation of phase diagrams, Pourbaix diagrams, diffusion analyses, reactions, etc.
-	Electronic structure analyses, such as density of states and band structure.
-	Integration with the Materials Project REST API, Crystallography Open Database and other external data sources.

  
👩🏻‍💻I tested the Pymatgen library with Boron Nitride (the same material that I was using in my master’s degree) to get XRD pattern, Neutron Powder Diffraction Pattern, TEM Diffraction Pattern from a database and shared the results here. 

🧊 A fairly comprehensive documentation has been written to help you get to grips with it quickly. They created a series of Tutorials and YouTube videos, which is a good resource, especially for beginners.
